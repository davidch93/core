# Core Project
Core libraries and dependencies for spring-boot-based and contains model class at a higher level of abstraction. 
This project based on Spring and Java 8 and basically to build any Rest API project. 
It is recommended to use [BOM](https://github.com/davidch93/core/tree/master/core-bom#core-bom) in using this project instead of using separate dependencies.


## How to install
We can run our goals like this for the Unix system:
```bash
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```

And the following command for Batch:
```bash
./mvnw.cmd clean install -DskipTests
```
